## Contributing to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.

- The pull request contains a fix a or new item rather than a duplicate
  of an existing one.
  (Go through the list carefully to verify that the item you're submitting
  is actually a new one.)
- The item you're submitting must be openly available and related to MSR
  or SBSE research.
  The additions you specify should be genuinely useful to MSR and SBSE
  researchers;
  the objective of this list is utility rather than comprehensiveness.
- Ensure the provided link is a stable URL. The golden standard
  is a DOI, which you can e.g. easily obtain for data you upload on
  [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/).
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Data Set Name](link) - Description`.
- Do not start the description with *A* or *An*.
- Maintain alphabetic ordering when adding items.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your contributions!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
