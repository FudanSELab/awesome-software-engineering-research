## Repositories

### Stack Overflow
  - [AnswerBot](https://github.com/XBWer/AnswerBot.git), Replication package of the paper "AnswerBot: An Answer Summary Generation Tool Based on Stack Overflow", ESEC/FSE 2019, [Paper](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5491&context=sis_research)

### API Recommendation
  - [BIKER](https://github.com/tkdsheep/BIKER-ASE2018), The dataset and source code for paper "API Method Recommendation without Worrying About the Task-API Knowledge Gap", ASE, [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3238147.3238191)


## Data Sets
- [Stack Exchange](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) - Anonymized dump of all user-contributed content on the Stack Exchange network.
- [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE) - A benchmark dataset and open challenge for code intelligence. It includes 14 datasets for 10 diversified code intelligence tasks covering the following scenarios: 1) code-code (clone detection, defect detection, cloze test, code completion, code repair, and code-to-code translation); 2) text-code (natural language code search, text-to-code generation); 3) code-text (code summarization); 4) text-text (documentation translation). 
- [Java-Annotation-Study](https://github.com/zhongxingyu/Java-Annotation-Study), Java-Annotation-Study, a large study on java annotation on code with annotated data set.
## Tools
- [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller) - Python Framework to analyse Git repositories.
- [GrimoireLab](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) - Toolset for software development analytics. By far the best set of tools to mine software repositories.

## Tutorials
- [msrWS](https://github.com/dmgerman/msrWS) - Tutorials about how to mine github repository, including some pdfs.
