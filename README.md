## Repositories

### Stack Overflow
  - [AnswerBot](https://github.com/XBWer/AnswerBot.git), Replication package of the paper "AnswerBot: An Answer Summary Generation Tool Based on Stack Overflow", ESEC/FSE 2019, [Paper](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5491&context=sis_research)

### API Recommendation
  - [BIKER](https://github.com/tkdsheep/BIKER-ASE2018), The dataset and source code for paper "API Method Recommendation without Worrying About the Task-API Knowledge Gap", ASE, [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3238147.3238191)


## Data Sets
- [Stack Exchange](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) - Anonymized dump of all user-contributed content on the Stack Exchange network.
- [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE) - A benchmark dataset and open challenge for code intelligence. It includes 14 datasets for 10 diversified code intelligence tasks covering the following scenarios: 1) code-code (clone detection, defect detection, cloze test, code completion, code repair, and code-to-code translation); 2) text-code (natural language code search, text-to-code generation); 3) code-text (code summarization); 4) text-text (documentation translation). 
- [Java-Annotation-Study](https://github.com/zhongxingyu/Java-Annotation-Study), This repository contains our code for studying Java annotation and its evolution, the collected large scale data about evolution of annotations in three years for each project, and our manual analysis of the characteristics of annotation evolution.
- [Project CodeNet](https://github.com/IBM/Project_CodeNet), The goal of Project CodeNet is to provide the AI-for-Code research community with a large scale, diverse, and high quality curated dataset to drive innovation in AI techniques. Project CodeNet is a large scale dataset with approximately 14 million code samples, each of which is an intended solution to one of 4000 coding problems. Project CodeNet aims to do for AI for Code what ImageNet did for computer vision.

## Tools
- [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller) - Python Framework to analyse Git repositories.
- [GrimoireLab](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) - Toolset for software development analytics. By far the best set of tools to mine software repositories.

## Tutorials
- [msrWS](https://github.com/dmgerman/msrWS) - Tutorials about how to mine github repository, including some pdfs.
